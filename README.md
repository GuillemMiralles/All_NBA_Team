# All_NBA_Team
### By: Guillem Miralles and Miguel Pay√†
#### In this project, we try to create a model to make a prediction of the all nba team.
The data is avaible in https://www.kaggle.com/drgilermo/nba-players-stats.
In the PDF it is better organized in case there is any doubt. I also made the predictions with the available data of the season still in play (you can see it in the pdf)
If someone wants to transmit something to me, they can do it to: guillemmiralles1@gmail.com
Thanks.
