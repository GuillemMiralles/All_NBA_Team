# All_NBA_Team
In this project, we try to create a model to make a prediction of the all nba team.
The data is avaible in https://www.kaggle.com/drgilermo/nba-players-stats.
In the PDF it is better organized in case there is any doubt. I also made the predictions with the available data of the season still in play.
If someone wants to transmit something to me, they can do it to: guillemmiralles1@gmail.com
Thanks.
